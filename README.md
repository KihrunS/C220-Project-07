A game about a button  
MSCH-C220 Final Project

## Theme
Since the prompt was one button, I wanted a game where you're encouraged to focus one pressing one button, and not driven to do anything else.

## Game Play
The objective is to find and press the button. The narrator talks to you along the way.  
Just search around the room, and once you find the button, press E to interact with it.

## What did you 
Importing the room was very difficult, as I had to go through every material and change its base map, height, and occlusion. There were also many lights around the room that were so bright I thought the textures weren't working. Aside from that, all of the implementation went very smoothly. Surprisingly, I ended up going for something a lot more story and narration based than mechanic based, which is fairly opposite of what I've done in the past.

## Implementation
- 3D first person gameplay
- Pressing a button as the mechanic
- Art environment
- Music, button press sound, and voice narration
- Animation for pressing the button, made by myself
- End screen and tooltip for interacting
- 3D level is the room

## Special Focus
My special focus was on vocal narration and delivering a message. To do this, I recorded narration voice lines for every room. I also came up with a small twist on the objective of the game, pivoting its meaning in the last room, and left the player with a message to think about. I would rate my own effort as 5/5, I put a lot of thought into where I wanted the story to go as I was making the game, and I took several attempts for each voice line.

## Future Development
I honestly really love this concept I've come up with, I might come back to it and refine it some when I'm not so busy.
